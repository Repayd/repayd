# REPAYD

**Deposit insurance for AI agents. The seatbelt, the airbag, the black box, and the fleet contract — one machine.**

> Everyone is giving AI agents wallets. Nobody is insuring them. Now there's a name for that.

*(Renamed from BULWARK this session — the on-chain run artifacts below still carry the historical `bulwark-verdict` tags.)*

A protected wallet that **holds** suspicious transactions for two minutes while a sealed, tamper-proof referee checks them, **blocks** clear violations outright, **proves who instructed what** (so owners can't fake attacks to collect insurance), and **pays back automatically — in the same block —** for whatever slips through. Coverage is priced by how the agent actually behaves: safe agents get cheaper every week. And the whole machine is sold as an API to the platforms that launch agents.

**This is not a mockup.** The protocol ran live on **Arc testnet** on 2026-09-11: 14 transactions, every hash independently re-fetched and verified, agent identity **894341** registered on the canonical ERC-8004 registries, a $135 covered-claim payout settled **in the same block as the verdict** (tx [`0xed020f97…a299f6`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0xed020f97235164333e416ae494c6b24462a6884e1aa2ba1a1898b85d07a299f6)).

**The design law:** *the AI narrates, the code decides.* No LLM judgment in any decision path — every tier, verdict, and payout is deterministic arithmetic that anyone can re-run and compare digests.

## Repository layout

| Package | What it is | Proof |
|---|---|---|
| `contracts/` | Solidity (Foundry): `PolicyRegistry`, `GuardAccount`, `VerdictContract`, `MutualPool`, `Blocklist` + ERC-8004 integration | **102 tests** (11 suites: unit + 1000-run fuzz invariants) |

## What we proved on-chain (Step-4, Arc testnet, 2026-09-11)

- 14 transactions, all re-fetched status 0x1, correct senders and contracts — [full table with Arcscan links](local/step4-final-report.md).
- ERC-8004 agent **894341**: identity owner `0x0549…33A6`, wallet binding verified; validation score **25 (COVERED)**, responseHash `0x1af03bc6…d3f0` matching the on-chain `VerdictAccepted.digest`; reputation feedback **−2500 @ 2dp**, tags `bulwark-verdict`/`covered`.
- Autonomous agent spending: 4 USDC payroll txs ($800 total) from the agent's own key.
- Attack #1 ($150 → 3-day-old wallet): **held, frozen, never settled** — FRESH_WALLET balance 0.
- Attack #2 ($900 admin override): **blocked pre-broadcast** — no tx exists, ATTACKER balance 0.
- Look-alike slip: held by the elevated lane, covered verdict → **$135 payout same-block** as the verdict.
- Daily-spend accounting honest on-chain: day 20707, $800 spent, count 4 — held amounts excluded.

## Live status by track (2026-09-12)

Full credential detail: [`docs/submission/credential-checklist.md`](docs/submission/credential-checklist.md) · per-requirement evidence: [`docs/submission/compliance-matrix.md`](docs/submission/compliance-matrix.md).

1. **The Graph — LIVE.** Both subgraphs deployed on Studio (`repayd-risk-arc` v0.1.3; ERC-8004 registries under slug `repayd` v0.1.1 — synced to head, agent 894341's validation + feedback fully queryable), the AI risk-posture consumer runs against the live endpoint (2.7× multiplier / 135 USDC premium computed from indexed Step-4 events). Cost $0 (free tier).
2. **Hedera — LIVE.** x402-gated Coverage & Risk API on Hedera testnet through the Blocky402 facilitator: **two real paid requests settled on-chain** (mirror-node verified), HCS audit memos on topic `0.0.10493275`, Scheduled Transaction `0.0.10493353` created and executed. Service stays hot for the video.
3. **ENSv2 — LIVE.** `atlasrepayd.eth` registered on Sepolia with the full §13 résumé in text records (5 txs, resolve-verified); zero-tx idempotent re-runs.
4. **Arc — LIVE except two optional cells.** Step-4 demo + ERC-8004 mirror + live dashboards + architecture diagram: DONE. Circle reads live (Wallets API `/v1/w3s/*` + Gateway unified balance); wallet create/spend awaits an entity-secret console reset ($0). **Mainnet rider ($5,000): DECIDED PURSUE — deploy pre–Sept 30 once funded (the only real-money item).**

## The fraud moat (the Cryptographic Alibi)

The deepest hole in agent insurance is the owner attacking themselves: drain the wallet, claim "hijack," collect. REPAYD proves which side the instruction came from:

- Every instruction the agent receives is hashed into a rolling chain: `keccak(prev ‖ origin ‖ ownerSigned ‖ ts ‖ keccak(instruction))`.
- Owner-console instructions are signed with the owner's session key; everything else is marked external.
- At claim time the alibi check runs: **owner-signed → DENIED** (the act of ordering the attack is the act of confessing); **external → COVERED EVENT.**
- Tampering breaks the chain visibly — `computeEntryDigest` is exported so anyone can re-run the check on public data.

## The critical invariants (fuzz-tested)

- **I1 — fund conservation:** funds leave a GuardAccount only via executed routine, released hold, or owner withdrawal.
- **I2 — custody never locked:** hold-state funds are always recoverable by the owner; fail-safe lapse never strands money.
- **I3 — solvency:** payouts never exceed junior + senior capital; insolvent claims revert.
- **I4 — no double claims:** one payout per breached tx hash (nullifier).
- **Payout ≤ cap; payout + deductible ≤ loss** — enforced on-chain and mirrored in the TS engine.
- **Signature discipline:** every verdict is ECDSA-verified against the watcher key (EIP-191, malleability-guarded, freshness-windowed, policy-hash-pinned).

## Scope honesty (deliberately v2)

- **Cat-bond reinsurance** — hook + attachment wired (`MutualPool.setReinsurance`); the live layer is roadmap.
- **Freeze partners / forensics fan-out** — the verdict engine emits the package; exchange integrations are post-hackathon.
- **Pricing v2** — v1 is the deterministic formula; "trains on the subgraph" is the roadmap slide.
- **TEE** — verdict core is deterministic TS ready for Chainlink CRE; the demo signs with a watcher key standing in for the TEE.

*REPAYD — hold what's suspicious, prove who instructed what, pay what slips through — in the same block — and sell the whole machine to every platform launching agents.*

## Deploying

The public frontend and the demo backend deploy separately.

**Frontend — Vercel** (repo root is the project root):

```text
vercel.json points the build at packages/web
```

Required environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://repayd.vercel.app
REPAYD_API_URL=https://<service>.up.railway.app
REPAYD_DASHBOARD_URL=https://<service>.up.railway.app
REPAYD_RUNNER_TOKEN=<shared secret>
```

**Backend — one service, one port.** `railway.toml` supplies the build and start
commands; the start script runs both processes and exposes the coverage API only
through a `/v1/*` passthrough, so the process holding signing keys is never
reachable directly.

```text
bun install                    build
bash scripts/start-service.sh  start
  ├── packages/api        :8787  loopback only
  └── packages/dashboard  $PORT  public: /api/* + /v1/* passthrough
```

The container needs the compiled artifacts (`contracts/out`, tracked) and a
writable volume for the run journal, mounted at `/app/.repayd`.
